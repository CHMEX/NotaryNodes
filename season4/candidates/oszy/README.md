# Oszy 


### Who Am I?
Many of you may already know me from Slack/Discord, 

I am a technology enthusiast ever since I can remember.

My day-to-day jobs were Back-end Web Development, Technical Support, IT System Administration, and Search Engine Marketing. 

---
I have joined the blockchain evolution in 2017, Komodo was one of the first projects I took interest in, seeing the technical knowledge and the dedication of their team, I knew it will be a great place to start and learn about blockchain.  I wasn't disappointed, right after I discovered the community, we had the atomic swap stress test, which at the time was a very technical test for me, and taught me a lot of new things.  Thus I am forever grateful to this community for everything I learned and for what We will accomplish together.

### What I do

As of today, I am a Community Moderator of **Komodo**, and a First Mate in **[PirateChain](https://pirate.black/)**.
In addition to the moderator role, I volunteer in Komodo and Blockchain related technical support, and community testing.
I am one of the Notary Node operators in [KMDLabs](http://kmdlabs.io/), Komodo's incubation and testing environment for developing Komodo-based Smart Chains and custom Antara modules.
