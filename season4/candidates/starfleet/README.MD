I truly believe in the success of digital assets over fiat currencies. Bankless payment systems without middlemen and access to financial services must be granted to all the people over the globe and are literally around the corner. Komodo plays a key role during this endeavor. AtomixDEX in combination with crypto conditions is the killer application. The Komodo notarization system is the backbone to a higher level of security and trust within a permissionless distributed ledger.

My team has an engineering background and the proper motivation to do the job and we will strive for managing 1-2 notary nodes around the globe. All the more we are proud to perform the notarizations part if I getting elected.
