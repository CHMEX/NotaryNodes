## About me:

Manager of the KomodoPlatform QA/Support division. Trying to help make our tech as usable as possible on as many fronts as possible.
S3 notary node operator, also maintaining KMDLABs NN. Bachelor of nuclear physics and technologies, chess candidate master. In a free time learning new things and playing League of Legends.

In this proposal, I'll not make any plans on ecosystem projects funding because good opportunities for funding are some non-deterministic thing as previous season shown me. 
My main motivation for NN running is performing of notarizations to keep the network secure with incentives receiving and spending :) (fair in my opinion) with following new NN bible rules for sure.

If you individual or group of individuals with a fire burning in their eyes and idea to build project on Komodo tech: I can allocate a grant from NN earnings.
Note that with the current price this offer aimed at individuals mostly who need servers for playing and etc. 

For consultation/discussion/advice on apps/projects creation on Komodo tech topic feel free to contact me in:
### KomodoPlatform Discord `TonyL#3577`
### Email: `alysakov at komodoplatform.com`

Thank you for reading that. Wish you a productive day/night! <3
