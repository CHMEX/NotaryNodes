## About

webworker01 is a North American Notary Node operator since Spring of 2018. During that time he's continued to tinker and work on keeping his node operations at peak performance while learning and contributing to the Komodo ecosystem.

With modest server specs, daily attention to node operations allowed him to reach top performer in North America and #3 overall in the notary network for the 2018-2019 season.

## Disclosure

I am not an official member of Komodo team, but a contributor where my skills allow.
