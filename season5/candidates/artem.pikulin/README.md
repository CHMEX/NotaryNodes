## Artem Pikulin NN proposal

I joined the Komodo Platform dev team more than 3 years ago, my first contribution was ETH and ERC20 integration to MarketMaker 1.0 (BarterDEX backend).
After that, I was offered to lead the MarketMaker full rewrite to Rust, which was successfully completed.
The project keeps evolving as [AtomicDEX-API](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API), it's the core part of all AtomicDEX GUIs.
In addition to my dev contributions, I would like to support the ecosystem by running the Notary Node in Russia.
