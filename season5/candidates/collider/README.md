## Introduction

Crypto Collider is a long running project focused on innovative cross-chain gaming and educational tools for the Crypto industry, especially featuring its flagship game the 'Collider Trading Arena' that has been providing fun games since 2014.

Collider is using Komodo's base technology for the completion of its vision as a fully decentralised cross-chain multi-purpose application (Collider V2).

Crypto Collider is proposing to become a Notary Node (SH region) in order to support the Komodo Network, the Collider project and create additional benefits for all Komodo Based assets. 

By becoming a Notary Node Crypto Collider will add significant contribution to the Komodo Community including the following benefits:

- Extend network infrastructure using the most reliable, fast and secure data centers in Australia. 
  - Focusing on the Oceania region, specifically Australia, Collider's node will use only the highest quality service providers regardless of hardware costs; the priority is high performance & availability.

- Aditional electrumX servers 
  - Collider also offers its resources to boost the electrumX lite wallet infrastructure as needed/requested by the Komodo team. A portion of the notary income will be used to support any extra servers as they are needed.

- dPOW Funding for Collider's Smart Chain
  - A small portion the Notary income can be used to fund dPOW for the recently launch Collider Coin smart chain. This will allow Collider Coin to be traded and integrated with new services without fear of 51% attack, which in term helps to grow the Komodo eco-system.

- Funding for KMD & Collider Marketing
  - A significant portion of the Notary income will be used for marketing activities around the promotion of the Komodo platform, its eco-system and capabilities. Collider's Trading Arena, KMDLabs, Pirate Chain, Versus Coin, Chips Poker and Marmara Credit Loops will be highlighted as primary examples and promoted through direct integration with each other (ie. play/use & trade all assets in the single Collider or Komodo app). Promotions may include Collider Arena tournaments, engagement prizes and advertising.

- Funding for KMD Eco-system assets to be integrated and consistently played in Collider's Games
  - Starting with the Trading Arena, Komodo eco-system assets like Pirate, Verus, KMDLabs, Chips & Marmara will be prioritised for integration with Collider's Apps. A portion of the Notary income will be used to generate consistent playing of these assets in the trading arena and this means more exposure, more holders and more trading volume for all.

- Funding to provide liquidity in the Collider Coin / KMD pair through AtomicDex
  - Notary income will also be used to provide a market making service for the Collider Coin pairs (especially KMD) on AtomicDex, adding benefit for all Collider and AtomicDex users. 

- Additional liquidity in KMD eco-system assets through AtomicDex
  - In order to provide consistent play with KMD based assets in the Trading Arena, Collider will source the assets through AtomicDex and also encourage the Collider players to use the AtomicDex for swapping their game accumulated assets. This ensures a consistent increase in trading activity to benefit of all aDex users.

- Additional Monitoring and integration capability for Collider V2 roll-out
  - Collider V2 will depend heavily on multiple custom chains and multiple layers of notarisation, being a notary node provider itself will provide fine detailed direct implementation and monitoring experience that will be invaluable to the successful design, release and scaling of Collider V2. 

#### In summary Collider's focus for becoming a Notary Node is to provide not just infrastructure but also using the consistent KMD denominated income to support the usage and growth of all KMD eco-system assets through game integration, additional Dex liquidity and marketing/promotional initiatives.


## Human & Hardware Resources

Collider will use highest availability mission-critical data-centers in Australia provided through Amazon Web Services (AWS or a competitor if a superior choice can be found). Collider's creator and head administrator will monitor the health of the notary node both manually and using automated performance monitoring software from a separate location and provider. Collider's creator and the Notary Node administrator, Clint Jones, has been responsible for setup and maintenance of up to 20 separate linux Crypto wallet servers (in order to provide Collider's Trading Arena) with consistent operation and security since 2014, and linux web servers for high traffic clients for ~10yrs previous.

Thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to be part of the growing Komodo community that I hope Collider can contribute in many meaningful ways, including becoming a notary node and realising the potential of Komodo's tech through full decentralisation of Collider's current and future games and tools!

Our project will be eternally grateful for your vote and is dedicated to returning as much value as possible to the Komodo eco-system regardless of result, we are here to stay thanks everyone!
