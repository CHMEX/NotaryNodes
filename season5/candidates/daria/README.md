## Vote for me

Region: AR

Address: `RFxBgg7HLFxZwb94iyLthKmuK4EZcrFZZy`

I would like to run my node in Singapore in order to decentralize the network as it seems like there are not that many nodes around in that area.

## Reasons to vote for me

- I will donate 10% of the reward to the community projects.
- I will bring diversity in the NN representation.
- Years of backend development and experience with server administration and automation.
- I am always around in case anyone needs to contact me or there are updates which need to be applied.

## About me

I am a fullstack developer and designer and I have been involved with crypto for the past 4 years. In Komodo world I work on two community projects - CHIPS and TOKEL. You might have read some of my CHIPS udpates which we ship once a week on Friday. In case you havent highly advice to check it out as sometimes they are quite fun :) 

I like the way Komodo is evolving and its community. Everyone seems to be welcoming and always keen to answer questions no matter how many and what they are :D This is one of the reasons I would like to apply for a Notary Node position. I would like to support Komodo in all possible ways. Running a notary node will be also be a great opportunity to understand Komodo and blockchain technology on a deeper level.

I believe Komodo has future and I would love to be a part of it.

I also believe we need more ladies around as they make everything just a little bit better ðŸ˜œ!

### CHIPS

I do a lot of work around CHIPS - development, design, testing, general organizing of the project, community announcements and updates. I mainly focus on the GUI for Pangea Poker implementation that we are working on. I really love CHIPS and I would love to see it succeed which I am confident it will. In case you do not hold any CHIPS, good time to get some ðŸ˜‰.

I got referred to CHIPS by my friend who used to work on the project. I am very grateful it happened and now I am part of the Komodo community.

### TOKEL

Couple of months ago I also started working on TOKEL. It seems to be getting a lot of interest from the community which is exciting. TOKEL will be Komodo ecosystem's token platform. It is under development at the moment with a lot of support from the Komodo's development team.

## Notary Node Goals

I will make sure the node I am running is secure, reliable and always up to date with network changes. 

I will donate 10% of my NN rewards towards CHIPS and TOKEL.

I will be always readily available for updates and changes.
