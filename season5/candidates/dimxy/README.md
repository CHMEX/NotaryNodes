Hello all,

I am dimxy, a software engineer for more than 25 years. 
I am a komodo team member since November 2018.
My duties is cc modules development. For the passed time I have been working on tokens and assets cc, nspv client and server-side code. 
Also, I am a contributor for the marmara project. During this project I did not only marmara cc code development but also studied komodo PoS implementation and made many tests to research PoW and PoS coins generation structure and adjusted staking parameters to satisfy marmara specific requirements. We also successfully went through a couple of hardforks in marmara. Thankfully to the marmara we found and fixed several issues in cc technology and created useful statistic rpcs.

Before my work in crypto, I worked in an IT company that was engaged in various state IT system projects for many years. My job there was developing applications, system architectures and doing various research works for our customers. I think, a interesting experience would be that we deployed and provided on-site and off-site support for our developed systems at customer locations throughout the country.

My motivation for participation in komodo notarisation project is willingness to help our great team to secure our network and get better acquainted with our technologies in practice.
