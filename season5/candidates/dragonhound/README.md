## Who am I?
I'm a bloke with two dogs, and I've been part of the Komodo Community since early 2018, spending my spare hours learning, building and testing.
Most of this work was self-directed until I was honored with a place within the team as a dApp dev, support agent and QA tech.
Since joining the team the main focus of my work has been testing the AtomicDEX desktop app, writing and reviewing support guides, and 
creating a series of APIs, bots and dashboards (e.g. [stats.kmd.io](http://stats.kmd.io)).

I've been a Notary Node Operator for the last 2 seasons, and last year implemented automated balance alerts to ensure other Notary Nodes
are sufficiently funded to carry out thier notarisation duties, and alerts to prod any nodes that have stopped mining.

## Why Vote `Dragonhound`?
- Long term Komodo supporter and hodler. 
- Active Notary Notary operator since Season 3, contributing a variety of works to assist with smoother running.
- Always quick to update my Notary nodes when updates are announced.
- Assist with testing out misc updates for dPow, the Komodo daemon and AtomicDEX before release.
- Ongoing implementation of improved metrics and auditing of Notary Node related operations.
- Creating miscellaneous scripts, tools, bots and APIs to assist with Notary Node management and monitoring.

## What's in it for the community? ##
Collaboration and content. I have more ideas than time, and know there is talent within the community worth rewarding. If you have the time and talent to help, I'd like to tip you with tokens so we can build something awesome.

NN income (after server costs) will be split as follows:
- 5% Canine charity dontations to local shelter.
- 5% GPS/IoT development (both that which I am doing, and toward bounties or approved community projects).

_I have some funds acrued from last season ready to support related projects on application_

## Server Spec
```
CPU: Dual E5-2690v2
RAM: 128GB
Speed: 10GigE
HDD: 2x1TB SSD
Location: USA
```
_I am a Komodo Team member, and currently operating one Notary Node in the NA region_

### Thanks for your consideration and support!
