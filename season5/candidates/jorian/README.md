## Reasons to vote me:

I'm once again asking for your voting support :)

I have been a Notary Node operator for 3 years now, and I'm looking to extend this streak to help out the Komodo Platform in any way possible.

I have been around in SuperNET / Komodo since 2014, and I still remember the NXT days. I got more involved in Komodo when BarterDEX was in testing and have helped a lot with testing the first ever true decentralized exchange. Later on, I had a business with siu that helped businesses with their own blockchain, a business **with clients** that still runs to this very day.

- In the last year I have helped the CHIPS project, by writing better Docker files and by helping the testing team
- I am involved in the initiation of the TOKEL project, where we seek to initiate a Token chain tailored for the Komodo Platform
- I have started developing a better [RPC wrapper in Rust](https://github.com/jorian/rust-komodo-rpc), to make it easier to create Rust applications that compile to webassembly on the long term. I also started working on a [Komodo specific Rust library](https://github.com/jorian/rust-komodo), which contains Komodo specific data to work alongside with the RPC wrapper.

## PLEDGE

I am donating 33% of the NN income to the TOKEL project, every first day of the month.

With the rest of the funds I can work towards freeing more time to be more involved in the Tokel project, as well as other projects.
