## About me
I have 25+ years in IT anda little over 3 years of experience in recruitment  more recently.
I am a Komodo HR manager. I help to find and engage the talents that contribute to the making of Komodo tech and the people who together make us such a great team.
I believe that education is a key ingredient to adoption and I pledge to send 34% of the profits of this NN to a Scholarship Fund to provide financial support for short to mid term apprenticeship roles so that promising junior talents can get started and learn the ropes of our tech while assisting our team members with at least a basic income.
I pledge not to manage this fund and I propose these proceeds to be sent to and address which would require ate least 3 out of 4 team managers (Development, QA, Marketing and Business) signatures to be moved.
