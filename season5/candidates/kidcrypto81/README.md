Hello, everyone! I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Notary Node election. I have half a decade of work experience in the tech industry including SEO, UI/UX design, marketing, and project management. For a few years, I have been experimenting with mining. Now I run a couple of servers regularly.

I discovered blockchain technologies in 2014 and developed a passion for it. I learned about Komodo in 2017 and since then became interested in the community and its projects. Later on, I participated in BEER coin atomic swap stress test. Among other open source community projects, Komodo has very unique features such as AtomicDEX, Smart Chains technology, and advanced blockchain security.

## Why you should consider me? ##
- Reliable and knowledgeable in system security and server administration
- Long-term KMD supporter
- I think it would be beneficial for the notary node network decentralization
to bring new people on board.
- I would be glad to get more involved with Komodo and decided to donate
15% each month to payout bounties. Donations will be calculated after
server expenses are applied.

Thank you for taking the time to read my proposal!
