## Plans for NN Funds

#### Provide liquidity on AtomicDEX.

  In my opinion liquidity is the only real issue AtomicDEX is currently facing. If elected I will use Notary Node funds to provide more liquidity, on more coin pairs, to help tackle this hurdle. With more liquidity I feel AtomicDEX will grow into the most successful DEX available.

#### Spacecoin Development

  I will also use Notary Node funds for spacecoin. Potential options are dPoW listing, AtomicDEX-Mobile listing, development, exchange listings, or marketing. By growing the spacecoin project, I will be demonstrating the power of Komodo and AtomicDEX technology to new users.
