## Who am I ?

I have joined Komodo on October 2018. Since then I have been working as Core C++ Blockchain developer until February 2021 and I was in charge of creating various crypto condition (CC/Antara) modules. My work is behind modules like:
 * channels CC
 * gateways CC
 * side chain gateways (importgateways CC)
 * pegs CC (module which purpose is to create a stablecoin backed by various crypto currencies).
 * libnspv (ligthweight client)

In personal life my passion is car racing, and I'm competing in several championships in Europe. 

## Season 5 plan
As I'm no longer a team member of Komodo I am still a Komodo veteran with ~200 commits to the code base and this will be my 2nd NN season. My plan is to continue to support Komodo on per-need basis and I want to support decentralization of notary nodes for safer network. 

If you (individual or group of individuals) have some good idea to build a project on Komodo tech and it will benefit the Komodo community, I can allocate some funds from NN earnings.
