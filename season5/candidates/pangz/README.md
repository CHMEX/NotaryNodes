## 👩‍💻 Who is pangz?

- An **Information Systems Engineer** with a decade of experience **developing** a desktop, **web** and **mobile app**
- Operating a swarm of **30+ miners**⛏ running in **mobile phones** that provide hashing power to a known mining pool.
- **Developed a mining setup** and **maintenance** [scripts](https://github.com/pangz-lab/adb-verus-install) for mobile which are available for anyone to use free of charge. ( It can be found in my repository for those who are interested. )

## 📡Why should I be one of the NN operators?
- Will be the first one to establish a **node** in **Japan**🎌 which will certainly help **strengthen** the notarization process in the **Asian Region**.
- **Sufficient qualities** and **skills** to operate and maintain nodes in securing the blockchain networks **24/7**
- **Committed** to the **responsibilities** that goes with the operation to the best of my **knowledge**, **skills** and **experience**.
- Plan to acquire a **solar battery pack** to power the nodes which will be designed to handle 50% of the power consumption in a form of green energy. In theory, that would give me **30%** to **50% daily uptime** during block-out which is although a rare case.

## 🤝Contribution to the community?

- Recently I **developed a mobile app** for verus in verifying block signatures which is currently in testing phase but will eventually be released free of charge for the use of the community. Same way, should **KMD** be needing something similar or any app that might benefit the ecosystem and the community as whole, I'd be happy to spend my time building it. 📲[Checkout the app here](https://github.com/pangz-lab/blockchain-apps/tree/master/release/verus_verify)
- Would be happy to **impart my skills and experience** to help produce tools and processes to support this community to enable us thrive and move forward.
