## Projects

### [Insight Explorer Tokens and NFT integration](http://explorer.komodoplatform.com:20000/tokens/TOKENSV2)
Added tokens and NFT transactions support to Insight Explorer. Besides that, I've made an improved version of [SEC wallet](https://github.com/pbca26/sec-wallet/releases) to create tokens and manage token holdings on any available smart chain.

### [Insight Explorer Marmara stats integration](https://explorer2.marmara.io/stats)
Improved version of Insight Explorer with Marmara stats integration.

### [Komodo hardware wallet tool](https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-wallet)
Developed an all-in-one Komodo hardware wallet tool for claiming KMD rewards and managing Komodo smart chains. Ledger and Trezor owners can use it to receive and send funds. Also, I created a [standalone desktop app](https://github.com/pbca26/hw-kmd-wallet/releases) to improve stability and overall user experience.

### [Trezor KMD integration](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/pull/354)
Helped to add required changes into Trezor firmware (model One/T) to support Komodo Rewards claiming.

### [Komodo Electrum wallet](https://github.com/komodoPlatform/electrum-komodo)
Integrated KMD into Electrum wallet. Electrum wallet is undoubtedly an industry standard when it comes to cryptocurrency wallets. KMD hodlers can use it on a day-to-day basis to send coins or claim rewards. It has quite a few great features that include HD wallet support, invoicing, multisignature address support, the ability to link and use hardware wallets (Ledger and Trezor), and several advanced features such as grained coin control, multisignature co-signers pool.

### [AtomicExplorer](https://atomicexplorer.com)
Developed a unique Komodo asset chain explorer that allows checking balances and transactions for an address or overview transactions across KMD asset chains. Among other features, AtomicExplorer has a standalone web wallet and KMD rewards calculator where you can see projected rewards breakdown for a specific period.

### [Agama desktop](https://github.com/komodoPlatform/Agama)
Co-developed multicurrency crypto wallet combined two modes native (full node) and SPV (lite mode). Rooted in the NXT project Agama served as an inspiration for the ZelCore wallet and as a code base for the VerusCoin wallet. Agama desktop supported 30 blockchains, 45 KMD asset chains, and hundreds of ERC20 tokens.

### [Agama mobile](https://github.com/pbca26/agama-mobile)
Developed the first KMD rewards claim capable and dPoW enabled mobile wallet. It was the first wallet to support various KMD asset chains along with dozens of blockchains as well as Ethereum and ERC20 tokens. Several projects adopted certain parts of Agama mobile code e.g. Chameleon wallet and Verus Mobile.
