# Welcome to my NotaryNode 2021 Proposal

## Preface
I truly believe in the success of digital assets over fiat currencies. Bankless payment systems without middlemen and access to financial services must be granted to all the people over the globe and are literally around the corner. Komodo plays a key role during this endeavor. AtomixDEX in combination with crypto conditions is the killer application. The Komodo notarization system is the backbone to a higher level of security and trust within a permissionless distributed ledger. Therefore I am proud to support the notary node squadron team.

## Introduction
