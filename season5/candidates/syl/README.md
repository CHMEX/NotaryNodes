## Who am I ?

Hello, I'm a 4rd year IT student from France.

I love computer sciences since childhood, I wrote my first lines of code when I was 9.

My predilection languages are `C`, `C++`, `C#` and `Lua`.

## Komodo Involvment

I'm working for Komodo since October 2020. 

For the moment I mainly work on [`AtomicDex Desktop`](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop), the beautiful secured wallet and decentralized exchange application of Komodo. It's entirely written with the help of `C++` and `Qt`.
