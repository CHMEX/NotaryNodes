# Tokelnode

I am submitting my application for a Notary Node spot, as a supporter of the Tokel project. I suggested to the team that they should run for a node, to assist with developing the project and bringing more awareness to it.

#### Regions: Asia/Russia

## :pushpin: The Tokel Project

Tokel is a KMD smartchain that enables the tokens, assets and oracless CC's. Anybody with 1 UTXO of TKL (the smartchain coin) can create a token (and even sell it immediately via the assetsCC enabled tokenDEX)
The project is creating an all-in-one, open source, GUI application that utilises nSPV (super-lite node application). This GUI will host a TKL coin wallet, multi-token wallet and exploring functions (for every token on Tokel), a tokenDEX for trading, an NFT marketplace and lastly, a token creation page, whereby anybody can create a token from their GUI.

If you'd like to learn more, please checkout the [website - https://tokel.io/](https://tokel.io/) or join our [discord for a chat](https://discord.gg/DZvuAR6QzX)

## :pushpin: Tokel Node Donations

## :pushpin: Server Specifications

This node will be located in either Singapore, or Japan. This will further enhance the decentralisation of the nodes in Asia/Russia
