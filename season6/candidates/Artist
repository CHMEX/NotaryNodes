## Who am I?

I am a developer in the Openfood chain team and I have worked with mylo in the komodo community for more than 3 years to deliver content revolving around the komodo ecosystem through platforms like ikomodo now komodefi.com. (The site is under progress and needs more time). I have been within the community for long enought to consider myself capable of your selection for a notary node.

I am a strong believer that content is the key to onboard non-technical people to this tech-savy industry and to the komodo ecosystem and together we can acheive it. 

I am a passionate game developer and have experienced with a couple of projects as a hobby with a few GDDs to spare I am really into the corelation of games and blockchain and want to work on a couple of titles.

## Current Projects

### 1) [Komodefi](https://komodefi.com/)
### 2) [Openfood Chain](https://thenewfork.com/team/)

## Pledges if elected

1) Write 4+ editorials a month on Komodo Ecosystem, AtomicDEX.
2) Create more content for Developers such as tutorials and cookbooks.
3) Improve the Komodefi.com website to make it into a full fledge newspaper for the komodo ecosystem.
4) Work on at least one game _(MVP)_ .
5) I also thought along with Mylo that the community should have a dedicated merchandize store for komodo and we should accept payments only in komodo and its smart chains tokens. (Making use of the outdated woocommerce plugin), we have a domain and website builder allocated for that.
