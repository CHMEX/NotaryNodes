## Reasons to vote for me

This is my second time participating, I made a jump in the 2021 notary testnet and would be thrilled to become a link of the chain.   
I'm working as a freelance from my spaceship and I'll be highly available, basically always at the battlestation. I'm in a good position to fulfill my duties as a NN operator.  

## About me

I am a web developer and designer with 20+ years of technical background. I'm a early advocate of open source approach for building things together.

I have been following the emergence of crypto since a long time, decentralization has always been a great concern for me. I believe it is a necessary foundation for a more functional society. I was introduced into the practical world of crypto and the Komodo project (SuperNET at that time) by metaphilibert who shared his deep knowledge generously and patiently. Two years ago, I stepped a foot into the cryptoverse and became more and more committed. I also started mining with GPUs and I maintain several masternodes.

I have experience in deploying, maintaining and monitoring linux servers, and I'm happy to delve into the arcanes of blockchain technology.  
I would like to dedicate a significant part of my resources into this zone of the galaxy. 

All support would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
