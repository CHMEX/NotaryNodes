My name is Mikhail. As a full stack web developer and GNU/Linux enthusiast I have an expireince of multiple years of fulltime coding job and some time spent working with a web hosting company which gave me overall understanding of system administrating operations of the web servers. I specialize primarily on such technologies as Python, PHP, JS, Docker, bash scripting.
I am komodo community member for around 3 years and will try my best to be a good notary operator!

I have server hardware ready in EU DC with all the needed specs: 2 servers with 24T CPU, 128Gb RAM, 1Tb SSD and 1Gbit upstream.

*Vote for me and I will prove my efficiency and skills!*
