Hello, all! I'm a **Decker**, probably you already know me from participating in various projects of Komodo ecosystem or from previous year [proposal](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/blob/master/season5/candidates/decker/README.md). If you aren't familiar with it - you always could read it, using the link above. At present i'm a Komodo's `Core System Engineer / IT Expert` and focus of my main work now is a various improvements of Komodo Core Daemon (aka `komodo`) and wonderful, but underestimated *native wallet* KomodoOcean ([Komodo-Qt](https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean)). 

I am also participating in work on Komodo **dPoW** core, aka `iguana`. Every NN operator of S4 and S5 is familiar with my work and "achievements", for example, last year i fixed a one most strange and complicated bug coincided with the exhaustion of virtual memory, after a week of iguana work, and as a result - stopping making notarizations, until restart. After fixing this bug, work of notary ops has become a task much easier than it was in the past. I could mention my other achievements / milestones, or list all my skills, programming stack, etc. 

But what I would like to do now is simply to highlight my  consistent contribution to the Komodo Ecosystem and desire to make our projects better and simply to use.

What about Notary Nodes itself, last season (S5) i was an operator of 3 nodes `shadowbit_AR`, `shadowbit_EU`, `shadowbit_DEV`, the last two nodes have reached 1st place in their region by scores, and my `AR` node is ranked only fifth place in `AR` region. Anyway, as you can see almost all of my nodes are stable, reliable and have the one of best performance and notarizations count.

In the [Sixth Annual Notary Node Election](https://komodoplatform.com/en/blog/sixth-annual-notary-node-election/) i just want to apply for one spot in `AR` region, even though the rules allow me to claim more. So, today I am going to ask you to support me in S6 and vote for my `shadowbit_AR` node:
