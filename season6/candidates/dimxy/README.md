Hello all,

I am dimxy, a software engineer for more than 25 years. I am a komodo team member since November 2018. My duties is cc modules development. For the time in Komodo I have been working on tokens and assets cc, nSPV client and server-side code. Also, I am a contributor for the marmara project. During this project I did not only marmara cc code development but also studied komodo PoS implementation and made many tests to research PoW and PoS coins generation structure and adjusted staking parameters to satisfy marmara specific requirements. We also successfully went through a couple of hardforks in marmara. Thankfully to the marmara we found and fixed several issues in cc technology and created useful statistic rpcs.

Last year I spent working for blockhain part of the great Tokel project, improving Komodo cc-based tokens implementation and improving and fixing the nSPV part for the Tokel GUI. We moved to Cryptoconditions V2 (aka mixed more) version which allows better cc transaction validation and anti-spamming capabilities. We also have plans for new generic cc modules on the Tokel blockchain which will enable development of feature-rich DAPPs on tokens.

Before my work in crypto, I worked for many years for an IT company that was engaged in various state IT projects. My job there was developing applications, system architectures and doing various research works for our customers. I think, a interesting experience would be that we deployed and provided on-site and off-site support for our developed systems at customer locations throughout the country.

Until the present time my work in Komodo has been mostly related to cc blockchain applications and now I am willing to further extend my knowledge and experience with Komodo codebase, namely in dPOW and mining part, in theory and in practice.

My motivation for participation in the komodo notarisation project is also a desire to help our great team to secure our network and be more involved in the codebase maintaining and provide more support for our solutions.
