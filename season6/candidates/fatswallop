Hi, I'm new to Github but have been following KMD for a while and want to learn more.
I know some basic server and security stuff from making websites in the past and using native crypto in command line, and want to improve skills so I can make crypto related apps and services.
My coding skills are limited to bash, javascript and python, but I've played with a few others. 

If voted in, my server will be in the North America region with these specs:
- AMD Ryzen 5800X	3.8 Ghz X 16	
- 128 GB	RAM
- 1TB NVMe storage
