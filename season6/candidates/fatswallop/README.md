## FatsWallop 2022

Hi, I've been following KMD for a while and want to learn more technical things about how it works under the hood.

I know some basic server and security stuff from making websites in the past and using native crypto in command line, though I want to improve skills to make crypto related apps and services.
My coding skills are limited to bash, javascript and python, but I've played with a few others and enjoy the challenge!

Offline, I was a truck driver until last year but have since changed course by "learning to code" and open up more life opportunities.

If voted in, my server will be in the North America region with these specs:
- AMD Ryzen 5800X	3.8 Ghz X 16	
- 128 GB	RAM
- 1TB NVMe storage
