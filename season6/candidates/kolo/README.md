# Kolo Notary Node season 6 proposal

Hi! I'm Kolo and I want you to vote for me in the Notary Nodes season 6 elections. Here is why:

## Efficiency

There is no better proof than actual stats. Node kolo_AR is in the top 3 and participated in 44% of all notarizations done in the past season. This means that almost half of the notarizations during the season were signed by this node, totaling half-million notarizations. In other words - each second KMD blockchain notarization.

During the season 5 node had zero actual downtime (99.999% uptime) with updates and restarts taking no longer than a couple of minutes. When choosing the node operator - stability and efficiency is the main metric you should consider.

## Dedication

I joined Komodo at a very early stage countless years ago. Since then I helped to create Komodo itself, the Notary Nodes network, a perfect community, and lots of fun. During testnet stage and the first 4 seasons, I served as a Notary Nodes network advisor and elections master. NN network will always have a very special place in my heart with all its wins and losses becoming personal.

In fact, this proposals repo is created also by me :-)

## Knowledge & hardware

Over 18 (whoosh, I want my 2003 back!) years in web dev/DevOps/networks. Starting from a personal webpage dedicated to my rat in 2002 and a homemade shared hosting provider to one of the world's largest payments accelerators.

Powerful and efficient hardware setup (multiple Xeon hypervisors, NVMe drives, Mikrotik networking equipment) in AR region's largest Tier III data center is already serving for season 5.

## Plans

Apart from serving the most efficient notary node, I plan to again dedicate some of my time to Komodo Platform in some different areas where I can bring benefits to the ecosystem. Komodo community was the best I've ever seen and I know how to make it even better. I also participate in Komodo strategic partner projects bringing benefits back to Komodo.

Bringing more fun is the other task. I'm a large contributor of cat memes for the Komodo community and my next goal is to automate this process for example. by embedding them into each mined block.

If I get another spot I will also lease a white Tesla Model 3, so by voting for me you get me one step closer to my dream. The largest voters can also request bumper or window stickers. This will be my method of rev share :)
