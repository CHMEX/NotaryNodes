## Community

Hello community members, in season 5:
 * I put the funds to use to pay for Artist to continue to write articles and update website with articles relevant to the atomicdex ecosystem, which we hope to continue to build out with focus on atomicdex - please consider sending votes to artist so he can devote more time to it independently
 * Paid biz some funds to write about & create a walkthrough vid on CHIPS internals for upgrading dpow, from bitcoin-0.15 to bitcoin-0.22
 
 
 ## Current
  * Design the initial proof of concept and first commercial implementation openfood p2p system, with the help of the openfood dev team.
  * Looking to expand openfood into consensus layer code in some layer-1, with komodo continuing to be the top candidate
  * Further use of funds to community developments: with a view to make a game based on openfood code, like lemonade stand or hamburger stand
 
 
 ## History
  * Former komodo team liaison engineer, using this experience of working between the dev team & marketing gave me a unique opportunity to understand the depth of komodo's contribution to the p2p paradigm of software
  * Former telco engineer
  * Still dabble in code
