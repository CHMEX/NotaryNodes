Who am I?
I'm a Linux systems administrator with around 18 years of experience. In my early career, I was one of the first Internet Service Providers in my neighborhood in Bucharest/Romania. After years and a lot of nice experiences working in my own ISP Business, in 2015 i bought my first 4 BTC. Since then, I studied a lot about blockchain, and I foused on a few of those bleeding edge technologies and projects like Komodo. Komodo is one of my favorite projects.
