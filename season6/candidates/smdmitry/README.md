### Notary Node proposal ###

I'm the former CTO of Magnum Wallet.
I worked hard to support hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) and claiming rewards for Komodo with no additional fees.

Currently I am operating Notary Nodes in the AR and EU regions. smdmitry_AR is the top performing node in AR region. smdmitry_EU is in TOP5.
My goal is to maintain high performance nodes with timely updates and my priority is securing Komodo network.
I'm using top-notch servers located in several Datacentres and at home to provide divercity and reliability.

Last season I've supported Komodo ecosystem tools and projects developers with bounty.
