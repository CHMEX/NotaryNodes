## Candidate info

I'm the former CTO of Magnum Wallet.
I worked hard to support hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) and claiming rewards for Komodo with no additional fees.

Currently I am operating Notary Nodes in the AR and EU regions. smdmitry_AR is the top performing node in AR region. smdmitry_EU is in TOP5.
My goal is to maintain high performance nodes with timely updates and my priority is securing Komodo network.

Last season I've supported Komodo ecosystem tools and projects developers with bounty.

## Hardware

I'm using top-notch servers located in several Datacentres and at home to provide divercity and reliability.
