# TOKEL

I am submitting my application for a Notary Node spot, as a supporter of the Tokel project.

Region: North America

**NA** region VOTE2022 address : `RP2M9tNyuuLVcTWuH3neL16TzRNYNSjSbu`

## :pushpin: The Tokel Project

Tokel is a KMD smartchain that enables the tokens, assets and oracles CC's. Anybody with 1 UTXO of TKL (the smartchain coin) can create a token (and even sell it immediately via the assetsCC enabled tokenDEX)

### Accomplishments

This last year Tokel has been hard at work to release the first on-chain TokenDEX dapp, using nSPV to easily send and receive tokens & NFTs without having to download the full blockchain.

Current functionalities of the Tokel dapp:
- Create your own token
- Trade your token using the on-chain DEX (release in the coming days)
- nSPV support for both TKL and its tokens + NFTs
