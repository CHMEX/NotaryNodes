## Introduction

**Hi, I'm [Biz](https://github.com/who-biz).**  This is my 2nd year running for election as a Notary Node operator.

I spend much of my time as Lead Developer of [The Blur Network](https://blur.cash).  For the past two years, nearly all of my work has focused on KMD-based technology, *and particularly dPoW*.  Skills and experience are split between XMR-like and BTC-like blockchains.

Time over the past year was split between CHIPS and BLUR development.  More recently, I've been active in VRSC community as well.

CHIPS development consisted largely of upgrading to v22.0 of Bitcoin source code, while maintaining backward-compatibility with v0.16.0 API & dPoW.  Partially implemented `nspv` on upgraded codebase, afterward.

Since April 2019, I have been working on integrating dPow with Blur (and more broadly: all Monero-based blockchains).   

## Development Efforts in the Komodo Ecosystem

- [`chips-v22`](https://github.com/who-biz/chipschain/tree/nspv-develop) - Upgraded v22.0 CHIPS, fully compatible with dPoW.  NSPV partially added.

- [`chips-upgrade-review`](https://github.com/who-biz/chips-upgrade-review) - Document summarizing upgrade of CHIPS, with specific focus on KMD infrastructure & compat.

  - Accompanied by video walkthrough: [Part One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEZ6bxyKUHk) || [Part Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlaLSGBNuag)

- [`verus-pbaas`](https://github.com/who-biz/verus-pbaas) - WIP guide for PBaaS chain generation on Verus blockchain.

- [`dpow-blur`](https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur) - Upgraded version of [`blur`](https://github.com/blur-network/blur) full node software, for compatibility with KMD's dPoW.

- [`blur-api-cpp`](https://github.com/blur-network/blur-api-cpp) - A compatibility layer for interfacing with `iguana`'s API, negotiates between JSON-RPC specifications.

- [`blur-explorer`](https://github.com/blur-network/blur-explorer/tree/testnet) - A testnet explorer for The Blur Network, which features new dPoW mechanics for XMR-based blockchains.


**Prior contributions during S5 testnet & election:**


- [`blur-network/dPoW`](https://github.com/blur-network/dPoW/tree/blur-2021-testnet) - Modified `2021-testnet` dPoW with added files for notarizations of BLUR->KMD.

  - Instructions for addition of Blur as 3P coin, to existing 2021-testnet NN network [available here](https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/blob/testnet/docs/kmd-2021testnet-setup.md).
  
- [`who-biz/komodo_scripts`](https://github.com/who-biz/komodo_scripts/tree/from-wif) - Modified `genkomodo.php` script, to generate litecoin keys/addresses from a user-supplied WIF

  - Used by some `2021-testnet` operators in LTC testnet.

- [`who-biz/nntools`](https://github.com/who-biz/nntools/tree/2021-testnet) - Modified `webworker01/nntools` for testnet, added `txid` column for display when running `stats`.

  - Also used by some `2021-testnet` operators for LTC testnet.

## Community Efforts

- Contributor to various projects/initiatives in extended KMD ecosystem (KMD, CHIPS, VRSC, BLUR)
- Received a Certificate of Recognition from Komodo team in 2021.

## Why Vote Biz?

1. **Initmately familiar with dPoW**

Almost all of my recent work has taken place within KMD's ecosystem (with a primary focus on dPoW and 3rd party integrations)

2. **Consistent desire to further strengthen my technical involvement in KMD ecosystem**

3. **I will be a technical liaison for KMD & BLUR (and future XMR-based integrations)**
 
Blur is already being integrated with the same systems run by KMD's notary network.  Being a S6 Notary Node Operator would provide me with the opportunity to work with the software I've been writing, in the most hands-on way.  This will benefit both KMD and BLUR via quicker problem-solving while integrating Blur, as well as any other XMR-based chain which DPoW may secure in the future.

4. **Notary Node rewards will allow me to focus more time on KMD ecosystem projects**

5. **You'll be guaranteed a very active Notary Node Operator**

With Blur being integrated with DPoW, much of my time will be focused on interfacing with Komodo's network.  Put simply, I'll be available and active every day.

## KMD Ecosystem Contributions

A total of **15%** of Notary Node Rewards (in excess of server costs) will be donated back into KMD ecosystem projects.

- **9%** to Blur-dPoW development 
- **3%** to Chips development
- **3%** to Tokel development

Calculations will be made at the beginning of each month, for the month prior.  Server costs will be covered first, and remaining rewards will be dispersed according to schedule above.
