I am a passionate game developer and have experienced with a couple of projects as a hobby with a few GDDs to spare I am constanty looking forward to work on a title that connects gaming with Blockchain and make the Game-Economics transparent and fair for Developers and Players.

<h2> Why should you choose me? </h2>

A long term supporter and contributer doing what I can within the community for more than 4 years now and I consider myself capable of your votes.


<h2> Pledges to The Community: <h2>

<h4> 1) Create a personal dedicated blog on the Komodo Ecosystem. </h4>

<h4> 2) Build a Reddit Tip Bot for Komodo. </h4>

<h4> 3) Proactive updates to the front end and functionality of the Komodefi-app (Market Maker 2) to  make it adaptable for the community with Mylo. (Will do Nonetheless). </h4>

<h4> 4) I think the community should have a dedicated merchandize store that will accept payments in Komodo making use of our outdated woo-commerce plugin which will need a lot of development work. </h4>
