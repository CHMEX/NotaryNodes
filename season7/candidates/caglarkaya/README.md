# Caglar Kaya Notary Node Proposal (Season 7)

I am an experienced software developer and researcher with a background in decentralized wireless networks, and I have been contributing to [AtomicDEX-API](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API) as part of the Komodo team for over a year. My most significant contribution involves the implementation of Watchtower nodes, a vital feature that will ensure the completion of swaps even if one or both parties become offline. As a dedicated Komodo team member with long-term plans to contribute to the AtomicDEX API, I would like to operate a notary node in the EU region.
