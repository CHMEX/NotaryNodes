## Who ComputerGenie Is

Throughout my time in the Komodo community I have been seen with equal parts admiration and disdain. Those that like me really like me and those that do not really do not.

Setting my personality aside, it's near impossible for anyone to even attempt to lay the claim that my heart isn't with making Komodo, and the ecosystem
surrounding it, the best technology and currency that it can be. To sum it up in a single word: dedication.

In season 6, I had a Top 3 Notary node in both the EU and NA regions, as well as being the operator of 3 nodes for others resulting in a Top 3 node for each of them in EU, NA, and SH regions.
