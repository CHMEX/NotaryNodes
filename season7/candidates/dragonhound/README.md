# NN Season 7 Proposal for *`Dragonhound`* (smk)



## Who am I?
I'm a bloke with two dogs, and I've been part of the Komodo Community since early 2018, spending my spare hours learning, building and testing.
Most of this work was self-directed until I was honored with a place within the team as a dApp dev, support agent and QA tech, which is a great role to [absorb](/#3) information about Komodo's technologies.

Most recently the main focus of my work has been QA/Dev on the AtomicDEX apps, testing new AtomicDEX API features, writing / reviewing support guides, and creating a series of APIs, bots and dashboards (e.g. [stats.kmd.io](http://stats.kmd.io)).

In my spare time, I work on things like the [PytomicDEX Makerbot](https://github.com/smk762/pytomicDEX_makerbot).
I've been a Notary Node Operator for the last 4 seasons, and for the last 3 seasons have been responsible for distribution of notarisation funds to all the other Notary Nodes.


## Why Vote `Dragonhound`?
- Long term Komodo contributor and hodler. 
- Active Notary Notary operator since Season 3, contributing a variety of works to assist with smoother running.
- Always quick to update my Notary nodes when updates are announced, and offer [advice](/#4) to those who ask.
- Assist with testing out misc updates for dPoW, the Komodo daemon and AtomicDEX before release.
- Contributing code to the AtomicDEX desktop wallet, support via Discord, and guides via youtube & [https://developers.komodoplatform.com/](https://developers.komodoplatform.com/)
- Ongoing implementation of improved metrics and auditing of Notary Node related operations.
- Creating miscellaneous scripts, tools, bots and APIs to assist with Notary Node management and monitoring.
