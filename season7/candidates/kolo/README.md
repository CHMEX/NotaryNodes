# Kolo Notary Node season 7

Thanks everyone for supporting me all previous years from season 0 up to this season, it's been 7 years! I appreciate that! I will do my best, as before.

## Proposal

Hi! I'm Kolo and I want you to vote for me in the Notary Nodes season 7 elections.

![why](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2559459/165963726-f03cd219-671b-4962-be87-42150ea16f8d.jpg)

## Key reasons to vote for me:

- 7 years of experience. Started by season 0.
- 4 years as a Notary Nodes network advisor.
- Always best possible stats.
- Large investment in hardware in AR region - uptime 99% during seasons 5 and 6.

Powerful and efficient hardware setup (multiple Xeon hypervisors, NVMe drives, Mikrotik networking equipment) in AR region's largest Tier III data center is already serving for seasons 5-6.

## Dedication

I joined Komodo at a very early stage countless years ago. Since then I helped to create Komodo itself, the Notary Nodes network, a perfect community, and lots of fun. During testnet stage and the first 4 seasons, I served as a Notary Nodes network advisor and elections master. NN network will always have a very special place in my heart with all its wins 
and losses becoming personal. In fact, this proposals repo is created also by me.

Over 20 (whoosh, I want my 2003 back!) years in web dev/DevOps/networks. Starting from a personal webpage dedicated to my rat in 2002 and a homemade shared hosting provider to one of the world's largest payments accelerators.
