## about:

As an expert system/low-level programmer experienced on operating systems and compilers, I contribute to projects such as [nucleus](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/nucleus), [atomicDEX-API](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API), and [atomicdex-gui-auth](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicdex-gui-auth) as a member of the Komodo team. I am also actively involved in advancing the Rust programming language as a member of the Rust Programming Language Organization. Additionally, I am currently building a package manager([LPM](https://github.com/foss-lodpm)) for UNIX-like operating systems which is currently under early development stage.
