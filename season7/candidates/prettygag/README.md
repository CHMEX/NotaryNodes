Dear KMD Community,

I hope you are all doing well. I'm here because I'm a true KMD believer and with enough NN votes I'll earn the chance to prove it.
In addition to being a massive KMD enthusiast, I'm a well experienced in systems/networking administration, building custom rigs.
I've been operating as an independent IT contractor for a while.

I'm prepared to run KMD Notary Node to the best of my ability while also assisting community members where and when possible across a full range of potential matters which I might contribute advice towards drawn from years of real-world experience.

This is my first time running for a KMD Notary Node.

Thanks for reading my proposal!
